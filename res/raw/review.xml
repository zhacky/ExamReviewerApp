        <desc>Example:
James is twice as old as John. 
Seven years ago the sum of their ages was 16. 
How old is John now?

Answer:
10

Solution:
Let x be the John's age now.
2x will be James's age now.
(x - 7) is John's age seven years ago.
(2x - 7) is James's age seven years ago.

Thus the equation goes,

(2x - 7) + (x - 7) = 16

by simple math:
3x -14 = 16
3x = 30
x = 10

        <title>Percentage Problems</title>
        <desc>"For percentage problems, make sure you always end up with
the following equation:

Starting value * percentage = Ending Value

Similarly,

Starting value = Ending Value / percentage

And

Percentage = Ending value / Starting value

Example 1:
Out of 500 who took the exam, only 85% passed.  How many
students passed the exam?

Starting value here is 500. Ending value is X (Unknown)

Therefore,
500 * 85% = 425 students

Example 2:

Matthew is left with 10,800 Pesos after 10% was taken from the original amount.
How much was the original amount?

Ending value here is 11,500 while the Starting value is X (unknown)
However by analyzing the question, you'll see that the ending value is 90%
of the starting value.

Therefore,

X = 10,800 / 90%

X = 12,000 Pesos


Example 3:

An 8oz coke bottle contains how much amount (in percent) 
from a 12oz coke bottle.

From the statement above, the 8oz bottle is being compared
to a 12oz and the percentage is being asked.
Therefore,
Starting value is 12oz
Ending value is 8oz

The equation would be:   

Percentage = 8oz/12oz
Percentage = 0.67%
